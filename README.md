# CubeFPS

This is my first game built in Unity. It's a basic FPS game with a player shooting its enemies as they chase the player. The score increases as the players take down the enemies. The goal is for the player to stay alive for as long as he/she can and to try to beat their high scores for each of the 4 levels - easy, medium, hard, and impossible. The player is automatically respawned if he/she dies with new score and timer reset.

Link to the game can be found on Itch.io!
